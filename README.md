The main focus of this project is the study of the success rate for a SpaceXâ€™s partially reusable launcher, the Falcon
9. One of the main reasons this rocket is so well-known is the fact that it is partially reusable, which makes the cost
of each launch reduce considerably. For the study, we will take the published data of the launches of the rocket,
which includes orbit type, launch site, etc. With this data, our main objective will be to determine how the
likelihood of the rocket landing successfully is related to the different variables and circumstances of the launch.
